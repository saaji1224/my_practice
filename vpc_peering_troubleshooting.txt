								VPC troubleshooting
vpc peering is conncet two vpcs (source and destination)
1. AWS VPC peering issue.
2. AWS VPC peering not working.

steps:
1. Check the security group in source and Destination instance whether required ports are opend (or) not.
2. Check the VPC peering status is active (or) not. (some times waiting for acceptance and some time failure that status could be showing )
AWS console  > goto vpc console > goto peering conncetions > to check the status.
3. check both the instances are connecting individually.
4. check the total no of subnets in source VPC and check it properly associated with the route table.
goto vpc > select (source)one vpc > goto subnets > and goto routetabel (check route tables are available or not) and check
subnet associations 
5. check the total no of subnets in destination VPC and check it properly associated with the route table.
goto vpc > select (destination) vpc > goto subnets > and goto routetabel (check route tables are available or not) and check
subnet associations 
In this destination vpc we have only one route table 
6. check the sourec VPC route table whether routing for peering is configured with proper CIDR or not.
(in source vpc we have route table in that route table we need to had the peering routing entry that should be done through destination
vpc cidr)
goto VPC > select source VPC > goto route tables and check the > routes (peering is available or not)
7. check the destination VPC route table whether routing for peering is configured with proper CIDR or not.
goto VPC > select destination VPC > goto route tables and check the > routes (peering is available or not)

How do you handle build failures in Jenkins?

Handling build failures in Jenkins involves the following steps:

Monitor build status: Regularly monitor the build status in the Jenkins web interface to quickly identify build failures.

Review build logs: Review the build logs to identify the cause of the build failure. 
		   Build logs provide detailed information about the build process, including any error messages or exceptions.

Troubleshoot the issue: Troubleshoot the issue causing the build failure by following established troubleshooting procedures or 
	                by seeking help from the development team or community forums.

Update the build process: Update the build process to prevent similar build failures in the future. 
			  This may involve updating build scripts, configuring build dependencies, or modifying build steps.

Re-run the build: Re-run the build once the issue has been resolved. 
	          Verify that the build is successful and that the build artifacts are generated correctly.

Document the issue: Document the issue causing the build failure and the steps taken to resolve it. 
		    This information can be useful for future reference and for continuous improvement of the build process.

By following these steps, you can effectively handle build failures in Jenkins and keep your build environment running smoothly.

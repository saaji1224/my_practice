								S3 troubleshooting
1. S3 bucket showing Error access denied.( insufficient permissions to list objects)
2. S3 access column shows the "error" for all buckets
3. Troubleshoot "error" in the access field for buckets

point-1:  Check what is the status of other S3 buckets,whether all buckets are showing error or not.

point-2: Check IAM user/Role has the following permissions,
S3:GetAccountPubliAccessBlock
S3:GetBucketPubliAccessBlock
S3:GetBucketPolicyStatus
S3:GetBucketAcl	
S3:ListAccessPoints

point-3: Possible login from the root user and check what is the status of the error bucket.

point-4: check the bucket has any custom policy (root account)( goto s3>select properties only s3 policy can be edited by root user)

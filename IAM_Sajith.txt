							IAM(Identity Access Management)
IAM is a lift time free service
I--Identity-->Authentication--> it only login 
A--Access--->Authorization ----> after login what we do (like permission)
M--Management

In Identity having two futurs:
A. IAM User -- can access the aws consloe by using console,and cli and programmatic access .... 
when creation of IAM users we have two options 
1. console access permission
2. Programmatic/cli --- it gives access key and secret key and it is static 
3. SDK 

B. IAM Role ---> specific user/group on behalf off service
using IAM role we can generate Temparory Access key and secret keys
IAM role consists onyly Acess key and sercet key 
if we want to permission to IAM role to attach the policies.

If you want permission to user we want to attach policy
IAM policies:
policies are two types
A. AWS managed --Ii is pre-defined  (like Adminstration full access..)
if any services aws provide two type of Access
1. Full permission
2. Read only 

IAM Provide two maximum Access keys

B. Customer managed -- it is used to Operation Based finegrent control access 
In AWS policies are JSON formate

Inline policy--> it affects only sepecified users not effected in the policies
customied policy-----> it affects in the policies when ever we create new policy to new user we can use the customied policies list but we cant use
                        in-line policy but we have to create new in-line policy to new user


Inline policy--> it applicable for only particular user

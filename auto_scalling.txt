							Auto Scaling
I had faced Auto scaling issue.
step1: check our scaling policies to see whether an event trigger more than one policy
(some times what happens right in our auto scaling we have a custome trigger policy 
Goto autoscaling > in the autoscaling one option is available Automatic scaling in this section Dynamic scaling 
policies(in that excute the policy when: as required to maintain aveg cpu utilization at 70)

step2: verify if a scale-out policy and scale-in policy are triggered at the same time.
in auto scaling two types of scaling policy
1. scale-out policy- increase the capacity of ec2 instance
2. scale-in policy- decrease the capacity of ec2 instance 
when it is reached 80% utilization it is scale out (it means create new auto scaling group)
scale in : enable  (it means when our utilization back to normal it will scale in the capacity what ever new
provision instance right it will termimate that instance it will back to actual capacity of my atoscaling)
Auto scaling > activity (it shows the history 

step3: check auto scaling group already reached its minimum or maximum number of instance (check Desired capacity 
and maximum capacity (maximum capacity value is doble or triple the minimum capacity)

step4: check instances are in a cooldown period and instance warmup
in advanced configuration (Default cooldown: 300 it means to create next instance minimum wait for 300sec
default instance warmup:60 when the instances newly created come up with 60 sec)

step5: check if there is a lifecycle hook configured for amazon ec2 auto scaling group.
in instance management > lifecycle hook (it control the state of instances during the scaling process)
lifecycle hooks are two types:
1. lunch lifecycle hook
2. terminate lifecycle hook:

step6: check is there is any schedule action configured which conflicting the auto scaling group.
automatic scaling> under this schedular action is available 
step7: check suspended processes for your auto scaling group.
any change activity with our autoscaling instances right aws provide a option suspend processes in advanced configuration  
suspended processes: Terminate,lunch,health check
